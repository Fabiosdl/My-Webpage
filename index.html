    <p><em>Higher Diploma in Software Development and Bachelor in Civil Engineering</em></p>
    <p>I am a former civil engineer with over a decade of experience, 
        and I have recently chosen to pivot my career toward becoming
         a Software Developer. I recently graduate in Higher Diploma 
         in Software Development at Maynooth University, with First Class honors. 
         As I transition into this dynamic and rewarding field, I am both 
         enthusiastic and eager to apply my skills and knowledge in the job market, 
         making a meaningful contribution to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
