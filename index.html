<h2><p><b><em>Backend Software Developer (Spring Boot) with a Background in Civil Engineering</em></b></p></h2>
<p> After starting my career as a civil engineer, I discovered my passion for problem-solving in the tech world and
    transitioned into software development. Over the past year, I’ve specialized in backend development, primarily using
    Spring Boot to create powerful, scalable, and efficient applications. My engineering background has given me a
    structured, analytical approach to development, enabling me to design systems that are not only reliable but also
    optimized for performance.</p>

 <p> With a focus on building robust APIs and managing complex data flows, I’m skilled at creating solutions that drive
    seamless user experiences behind the scenes. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and delivering
    high-quality code that meets business needs. My unique combination of technical expertise and practical project
    management experience allows me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and deliver results on time.
